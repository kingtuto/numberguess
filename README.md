# numberguess
Game is pretty simple.
You have to guess a 4 digit number. You enter a number and in response you get how many digits you got right and in the correct position, and how many digits you got right but in an incorrect position.
Example: hidden number = 1234
If you guess 1002 you would get 1G1R. That means, there is one number in the correct position ('1') and one number in the incorrect ('2'). the rest of your numbers are wrong.
If the numbers are repeated, only one occurrence is taken into account.
Example: you guess 0445, you get 0G1R. the '4' is there, but in an incorrect position, only once.
