# Minotaurs & Cowboys
Game is a variation of the classic Cows and Bulls
## Rules
You have to guess a 4 digit number. You enter a number and every digit in the right position is a Minotaur, and every digit present in the number but in the incorrect position is a Cowboy.

### Example
Secret number: 1234

If you guess 1002 you would get 1M1C. That means, there is one number in the correct position (1) and one number in the incorrect (2). the rest of your numbers are wrong.

If you guess 0445, you get 0M1C. the 4 is there, but in an incorrect position, only once.

If the numbers are repeated, only one occurrence is taken into account.
